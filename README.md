One of the project of the AI Engineer path on Scrimba.

I use this project as an excuse to try shadcn's library, with Vite. One component even comes from [v0.dev](https://v0.dev/).

To use it, create a `.env.local` file with the following content:

```
VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
```

Then, run the following commands:

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

Please do not push it to production as this way of using the API is not secure at all! :)
